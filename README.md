# ToDoReact

This is a simple todo app for understanding the react

so :

in the App we called the first component which is todolist and through it, we called the todoitem for the todotask it displays the list of todos.

the todo form with three components :

1. Todolist
1. todoitem
1. todotask

totodata its an array with the dummy data

# Achievements:

as a user you can add as much as you like of todo lists and delete them, mark them, but the only thing is not working the Edit button in the future we are hoping to make it activate
